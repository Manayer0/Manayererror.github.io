  <h2>Our Coffee Beans</h2>
  <p>
    The coffee beans that we use are extracted from the finest types of coffee trees,
    they are 100% organic and are imported whole from Italy and are roasted in the
    store at a temperature of up to 225 °C (437 °F) until they are completely roasted
    and also ground in the store to be ready to prepare coffee. You can buy
    types of roasted coffee from the store to use at home.
